Twig syntax highlighting for Netbeans!

After struggling around with all that Netbeans and Java (X_x) stuff I managed
to get code highlighting working. Comments, blocks and variables are displayed in different colors.

TODO:

- Not only highlight blocks, but also content
- Make color settings configurable
- Let Netbeans highlight underlying code (HTML, JSON, ...)
